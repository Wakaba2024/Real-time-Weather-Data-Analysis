## 1. 📌 Project Overview

This project collects and analyzes weather data for major Kenyan cities — Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret — using APIs and Python-based data analysis.
The goal is to uncover patterns in temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover that can support decision-making in agriculture, tourism, outdoor event planning, public health, and urban development.

## 2. 🎯 Problem Statement

Weather variability significantly affects agriculture, tourism, and public safety in Kenya.
We aim to:

- Collect weather data from WeatherAPI and OpenWeatherMap.

- Store data in a suitable database (relational or non-relational).

- Analyze weather patterns using Python.

- Derive insights into temperature trends, rainfall patterns, humidity, wind, and cloud cover

## 3. 🔬 Key Insights

Based on the analysis

Humidity

- Mombasa shows consistently high humidity (coastal influence).

- Eldoret has lower humidity due to elevation.

- Impacts: agriculture, heat-related illnesses.

Temperature

- Mombasa is hotter year-round; Eldoret is cooler.

- Seasonal variations affect crops and public health.

Rainfall

- Mombasa: steady rainfall.

- Eldoret: distinct wet/dry seasons.

- Kisumu: irregular patterns affecting farming.

Temperature vs. Humidity

- Negative correlation: hotter days tend to be less humid.

Wind

- Eldoret (higher altitude) experiences stronger winds.

- Useful for wind energy projects.

Cloud Cover

- Mombasa has more consistent cloud cover, Kisumu more variability.

## 4.  📊 Applications

1. 🌾 Agriculture: Crop and livestock planning, irrigation strategies.

2. 🏖️ Tourism: Seasonal activity promotion (e.g., beach tourism in Mombasa, safaris in Nairobi).

3. 🎉 Event Planning: Schedule outdoor events in dry seasons or cooler times of day.

4. 🏥 Public Health: Monitor extreme heat/humidity risks.

5. ⚡ Renewable Energy: Wind and solar project feasibility.
